# Tracebit

A decentralized blockchain analytics and forensic intelligence platform for tracing transactions, identifying illicit activity, and automating on-chain compliance — all powered by community-verified data.

---

## Overview

Tracebit consists of ten modular smart contracts that together form an auditable, decentralized, and trustless infrastructure for investigating and monitoring blockchain activity:

1. **Entity Registry Contract** – Registers addresses, entities, and contract types with verified metadata.
2. **Suspicious Activity Oracle Contract** – Aggregates and verifies flagged activity from on-chain actors.
3. **Analytics Job Contract** – Facilitates posting and solving forensic tracing jobs via bounty mechanisms.
4. **Reputation & Scoring Contract** – Maintains reputation scores for validators and contributors.
5. **Alert Subscription Contract** – Allows users to subscribe to wallet or pattern-based alerts.
6. **Evidence Vault Contract** – Stores tamper-proof references to forensic reports and investigative chains.
7. **Dispute Resolution Contract** – Provides decentralized arbitration for contested analytics submissions.
8. **Compliance Module Contract** – Optional plug-in for DeFi protocols to auto-flag or block risky wallets.
9. **Payment & Staking Contract** – Manages bounties, rewards, and penalties for protocol participants.
10. **Governance Contract** – DAO for managing rules, model updates, and validator onboarding.
